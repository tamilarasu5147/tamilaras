1. Anil and Bhaskar can do a piece of work individually in 12 and 20 days respectively. They work together for 6 days before Anil decides to leave. How many days will it take Bhaskar to complete the work on his own?
A. 4  B. 14  C. 6  D. 3

Solution:
LCM of 12 and 20 is 60
A efficiency is 5
B efficiency is 3
= 5+3 =>8 *6 -> 48 -> 60-48-> 12--> 12/3 =4 days 

2. Dilip and Samrat can do a piece of work in 16 days and 24 days respectively. Samrat works alone for 15 days and leaves. In how many days can Dilip complete the remaining work?
A. 8  B. 10  C. 6  D. 7

solution:
LCM of 16 and 24 is 48
dilip eff = 3
samrit eff = 2
samrit works=15*2 = 30
dilip works = 48-30 = 18/3 = 6 days
Answer: 6 days
