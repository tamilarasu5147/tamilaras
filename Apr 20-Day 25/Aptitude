1. There are three pipes connected to a tank. The first two can fill the tank in 20 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. 
The third pipe can empty the entire tank in 5 minutes. If all the pipes are opened simultaneously, what time will it take to empty the tank?
a) 8.55 minutes
b) 8.56 minutes
c) 8.57 minutes
d) 8.58 minutes
Solution :
    1/20 + 1/30 - 1/5 = 7/60
Answer : 8.57

2. Three pipes are opened for 8 minutes each one after the other. The first two pipes can fill a tank in 20 minutes and 40 minutes, respectively. 
If the third pipe can empty the tank in 120 minutes, find the amount of water filled in the tank after 24 minutes. The tank is 480 litres.
a) 160 litres
b) 188 litres
c) 224 litres
d) 256 litres
Solution :
    capacity of the tank = 480 litres. 
    efficiencies of the pipes = 24, 12, 4 
    relative efficiency = 24 + 12 â€“ 4 = 32 litres per minute. 
    32 * 8 = 256 litres.
Answer : 256
