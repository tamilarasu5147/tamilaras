1.If two pipes can fill a tank in 24 and 20 minutes respectively and another pipe can empty 3 gallons of water per minute from that tank. When all the three pipes are working together, it takes 15 minutes to fill the tank. What is the capacity of the tank? 

100 gallons
150 gallons
125 gallons
130 gallons
120 gallons

Solution:
      wok done by outlet = 1/15 - (1/24 + 1/20)
                         = 1/15 - 11/120 = 3/120
                3 gallons = 1/40 = 120
Answer : 120 gallons

2.It takes 20 minutes for pipe A to fill the tank completely and it takes 30  minutes for pipe B to fill the tank completely. 
If both the inlets are opened together, then how much time will be taken to fill the tank completely? 

15 minutes
12 minutes
11 minutes
10 minutes
22 minutes  

Solution:
      1/20 + 1/30 = 5/60
      -> 60/5 = 12

Answer : 12 minutes
