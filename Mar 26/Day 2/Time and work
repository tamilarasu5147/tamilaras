Time and Work

1.Amruta can do a piece of work in 20 days.Narendra is 25% more efficient than Amruta.  The number of days taken by Narendra to do the same piece of work in?
Option:
a, 15 days
b, 16 days
c, 18 days
d, 20 days

solution:
 amruta = 20 days
 narendra = 25% of 20 less than amruta
              25% of 20 is 5 = 20-5 is 15days   Answer: 15 days

2.A can finish a work in 24 dyas B in 9 days and C in 12 days.   B and c start the work but are forced to leave after 3 days. The remaining work was done by A is?
Option:
a, 5 days
b, 6 days
c, 10 days
d, 11 days

solution:
LCM of 24,9,12 is 216
Therefore, efficiency of A =9
           efficiency of B =24
           efficiency of C =18
B+C is 24+18=42 for 3 days 3*42=126
B and C completed the work together is 126, remaining work is 216-126=90
=A=90/9=10 days  Answer: 10 days
